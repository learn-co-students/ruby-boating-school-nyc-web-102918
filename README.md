'Student' class:
<!-- * should initialize with first_name -->
<!-- * Student.all should return all of the student instances -->
<!-- * Student#add_boating_test should initialize a new boating test with a student (Object), a boating test name (String), a boating test status (String), and an Instructor (Object) -->

<!-- * Student.find_student will take in a student first name and output that student (Object) -->


'BoatingTest' class:
<!-- * should initialize with student (Object), a boating test name (String), a boating test status (String), and an Instructor (Object) -->
<!-- * BoatingTest.all returns an array of all boating tests -->

'Instructor' class:
<!-- * init with name -->
<!-- * return all instructors -->

#Is this supposed to be . or #
<!-- * Instructor.pass_student should take in a student name and test name and return status passed -->
<!-- * Instructor.fail_student should take in a student name and test name and return status failed -->
<!-- * Instructor.student_grade_percentage should take in a student first name and output the percentage of tests that they have passed -->


Run ruby tools/console.rb in console to seed

Here is some example seed data:

spongebob= Student.new("Spongebob")
 patrick= Student.new("Patrick")

puff= Instructor.new("Ms.Puff")
krabs= Instructor.new("Mr.Krabs")

test1= spongebob.add_boating_test("Don't Crash 101", "pending", puff)
